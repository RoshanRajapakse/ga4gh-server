REPOSITORY RETIREMENT NOTICE
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

The Genomics API was intended to act as a suite of integrated APIs each targeting a different aspect of exchanging genomic information between data providers and consumers. The Genomics API, together with the Reference Server and Compatibility test suite, was retired on January 24, 2018 and several of the sub-APIs are now being pursued under the auspices of new GA4GH Work Streams. We would like to thank those of you who have worked on this and look forward to ongoing contributions in the GA4GH Work Streams. You may still fork this repository if you wish to pursue developments. You may read the meeting minutes of the GA4GH Engineering Committee to learn more about the decision to retire the API. For additional questions or to get involved with ongoing technical work at GA4GH, please see the website at `Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
